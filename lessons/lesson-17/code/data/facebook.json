First, helping businesses to create new jobs by bringing in new investments, and upgrading existing companies. Second, helping displaced workers find alternative jobs as businesses restructure and technology disrupts our workforce. Lastly, helping workers grow in their jobs by upgrading their skills. \n\nI have asked Heng Swee Keat to take over the tripartite Future Economy Council from DPM Tharman Shanmugaratnam.

Had he been less steadfast, Singapore might have turned out very differently. \n\nFrom 1963-1965, Singapore was part of Malaysia. Malay PAP leaders came under intense pressure to abandon multiracialism and choose race over nation. They were abused, threatened, and denounced. UMNO leaders held rallies in Singapore, and made fiery speeches personally targeting Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Encik Othman. \n\nIn 1964, racial riots broke out during a procession to mark Prophet Muhammad\u2019s birthday. Encik Othman was there, and witnessed the violence first-hand. But he and his Malay PAP comrades stood firm. They kept the dream of a multi-racial society alive. That is why today we can say with pride, \u201cWe, the citizens of Singapore\u2026 regardless of race, language or religion.\u201d \n\nDuring Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s 75th birthday dinner in 1998, he paid tribute to his old comrade and friend, Encik Othman:\n\n\u201cOthman, I remember your staunch support and loyalty during those troubled days when we were in\nMalaysia and the tensions were most severe immediately before and following the bloody riots in July 1964. At that time, the greatest pressures were mounted by UMNO Malay extremists who denounced you and Malay PAP leaders, especially you, as infidels (kafirs) and traitors (khianats) not to Singapore but to the Malay race. I heard it, the crowd said it, bunches of them, they were designed to intimidate you and the other Malay leaders in PAP. Because of the courage and leadership you showed, not one PAP Malay leader wavered (in 1965) ... That made the difference to Singapore.\u201d\n\nEncik Othman\u2019s determination and courage did indeed make all the difference to Singapore. \n\nYou can view my full eulogy here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2onAYvy\n\n\u2013 LHL\n\n#RememberingOthmanWok \n \n(Video by Channel NewsAsia) \n\n------- \n\nMalam ini, kita memperingati seorang anak watan Singapura yang hebat, Encik Othman Wok.\n \nEncik Othman sangat percaya dan komited terhadap dasar berbilang bangsa dan agama di Singapura. Kalaulah dia kurang tegas, nasib Singapura mungkin sangat berbeza.\n \nDari 1963-1965, Singapura adalah sebahagian daripada Malaysia. Pemimpin Melayu PAP berdepan dengan tekanan hebat untuk menyingkirkan dasar berbilang bangsa dan mengutamakan bangsa daripada negara. Mereka diugut dan dikutuk. Pemimpin UMNO mengadakan rapat-rapat umum di Singapura dan membuat ucapan berapi-api yang menyasarkan Encik Lee Kuan Yew dan Encik Othman.\n \nPada 1964, rusuhan kaum tercetus semasa perarakan sempena Maulidur Rasul. Encik Othman berada di situ dan menyaksikan sendiri keganasan secara langsung. Tetapi beliau dan pemimpin  Melayu PAP lain tetap berdiri teguh. Mereka gigih berusaha membentuk sebuah Negara berbilang bangsa yang diimpi-impikan. Itulah sebabnya hari ini kita mampu berkata dengan bangganya, \"Kami, warganegara Singapura ... tidak kira apa bangsa, bahasa atau agama.\"\n \nPada 1998, semasa jamuan ulang tahun ke 75 Encik Lee Kuan Yew, beliau memberi penghormatan kepada rakan seperjuangannya, Encik Othman:\n \n\"Othman, saya masih ingat, sokongan padu dan kesetiaan anda semasa waktu-waktu sukar Singapura ketika kita bersama Malaysia dan ketegangan yang amat mencabar sebelum dan sesudah rusuhan berdarah pada Julai 1964. Pada masa itu, golongan pelampau UMNO mengutuk pasukan Melayu PAP sebagai kafir dan pengkhianat, bukan terhadap Singapura tetapi terhadap orang Melayu. Saya dengar kata-kata itu, disuarakan kumpulan-kumpulan yang sengaja mahu menakut-nakutkan anda dan pemimpin Melayu PAP. Kerana keberanian dan kepimpinan anda, tidak seorangpun pemimpin Melayu PAP yang patah semangat... Itulah yang telah menentukan hala tuju Singapura. \"\n \nJelas, kesungguhan dan keberanian Encik Othman menyumbang kepada untung nasib Singapura.\n \nVideo ucapan saya ada di sini: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2onAYvy\n\n\u2013 LHL","status_type":"added_video","story":null,"share_count":417.0},{"created_time":"2017-04-18T10:10:28.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1439169066145795","message":"Bade farewell to Encik Othman Wok at the Sultan Mosque this afternoon.

During Singapore\u2019s turbulent years in Malaysia, Encik Othman came under great pressure, and even threats on his life, for his convictions. But he stood firm, and that made all the difference to Singapore. \n\nEncik Othman was Minister of Social Affairs. He put in place measures that continue to serve the Malay community today. For example, he set up the Singapore Pilgrimage Office and the system of registration for sheikh hajis and pilgrim brokers.\n\nEncik Othman also took an active interest in the building of the first National Stadium, and promoted the Singapore Grand Prix years before F1 came to Singapore.\n\nFor his many contributions, Encik Othman was conferred the Order of the Nila Utama (2nd class) in 1983.\n\nMy deepest condolences to the family of Encik Othman Wok. His passing is a deep loss to Singapore. \u2013 LHL\n\n_______ \n\nAmat terkesan menerima berita pemergian Encik Othman Wok, antara bapa pengasas Singapura. Beliau berusia 92 tahun.

Beliau juga antara rakan pejuang terdekat Encik Lee Kuan Yew. Sepanjang tahun-tahun sukar ketika Singapura sebahagian daripada Malaysia, Encik Othman menghadapi tekanan yang sangat hebat. Nyawa beliau terancam kerana perjuangannya. Tetapi beliau tidak gentar, terus berdiri teguh dan ini membawa manfaat kepada Singapura.\n\nEncik Othman merupakan Menteri Ehwal Sosial. Di bawah kepimpinannya, beliau memperkenalkan langkah-langkah yang terus memanfaatkan masyarakat Melayu hari ini. Misalnya, beliau menubuhkan Pejabat Haji Singapura dan sistem pendaftaran untuk sheikh haji.\n\nEncik Othman juga mengambil berat tentang pembinaan Stadium Negara kita yang pertama dan mempromosikan perlumbaan Singapore Grand Prix lama sebelum F1 tiba di Singapura.\n\nEncik Othman dianugerahkan Darjah Nila Utama (kelas kedua) pada 1983 sebagai pengiktirafan sumbangan besar beliau.\n\nSalam takziah saya yang sedalam-dalamnya buat keluarga Encik Othman Wok.

Opening the debate, MP Tin Pei Ling \u9648\u4f69\u73b2 noted that while women had made great strides in society and at work, we still needed to close the gender gap and help women balance family and career.\n\nMPs discussed securing women\u2019s financial well-being and retirement adequacy, especially for those who become caregivers at home. MP Rahayu Mahzam (bit.ly\/2nWcrhT) and Dr Intan Mokhtar (bit.ly\/2nWlX4A), suggested designing a SkillsFuture package for women returning to the workforce. \n\nAnother issue is the expectation that women should not only strive professionally, but also be mothers and caregivers, unlike men. As MP Darryl David (bit.ly\/2o1Obgd) quipped, working mothers often need to work three \u2018shifts\u2019 a day \u2013 in the day as an employee, in the evening as a wife and mother, and at night to prepare for the next day\u2019s work after the children have gone to bed. He highlighted the need to support fathers who want to take on more family responsibilities, to support their wives\u2019 aspirations. \n\nThis motion had the support of both sides of the House. We seek to make Singapore the best home for all, where men and women have equal opportunities to pursue their aspirations, and reach their fullest potential. \u2013 LHL\n\n\u8fd9\u6b21\u5728\u56fd\u4f1a, \u6211\u4eec\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u52a8\u8bae\u3002\u9ea6\u6ce2\u7533\u9009\u533a\u8bae\u5458\u9648\u4f69\u73b2\u7b49\u540e\u5ea7\u8bae\u5458\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u8bae, \u547c\u5401\u5404\u754c\u652f\u6301\u5987\u5973\u5b9e\u8df5\u7406\u60f3\u62b1\u8d1f\u3002\u8bae\u5458\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u6709\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u51fa\u81ea\u4eba\u6c11\u884c\u52a8\u515a\u5987\u5973\u56e2\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u4e66\u3002\n\n\u4e49\u987a\u96c6\u9009\u533a\u8bae\u5458\u674e\u7f8e\u82b1 Lee Bee Wah (bit.ly\/2o37hCE) \u63d0\u5230\u5f88\u591a\u5987\u5973\u90fd\u60f3\u5f53\u4e2a\u8d24\u59bb\u826f\u6bcd\u3001\u5b5d\u987a\u7684\u5973\u513f\u3001\u79f0\u804c\u7684\u5ab3\u5987\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4e8b\u4e1a\u5973\u6027\u3002\u8981\u80fd\u5b9e\u8df5\u8fd9\u7406\u60f3\u9700\u8981\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u96c7\u4e3b\u8981\u6301\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u6001\u5ea6, \u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u79c1\u4eba\u4f01\u4e1a\u8981\u68c0\u8ba8\u63aa\u65bd, \u89e3\u9664\u969c\u788d, \u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u653f\u7b56, \u8ba9\u5987\u5973\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u6210\u5fc3\u613f\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u5bb6\u91cc\u6216\u662f\u804c\u573a\uff0c\u53d1\u6325\u6f5c\u80fd\uff0c\u7167\u987e\u81ea\u5df1\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u4ee5\u53ca\u9020\u798f\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002\u2013 \u674e\u663e\u9f99\n\nSenang melihat ramai Anggota Parlimen (AP) bangkit menyokong usul sekumpulan AP PAP untuk bantu kaum wanita kita capai aspirasi mereka.\n \nSepanjang 2 hari, beraneka saranan dibentangkan. Membuka tirai perbahasan, Cik Tin Pei Ling berkata walaupun kaum wanita telah mencapai kemajuan besar dalam kerjaya dan masyarakat, jurang perbezaan antara jantina perlu diperkecilkan dan kaum wanita harus terus dibantu untuk imbangi tanggungjawab keluarga dan kerjaya.\n \nTurut ditimbulkan, peri pentingnya kaum wanita menjaga kedudukan kewangan mereka dan ketika persaraan lebih-lebih lagi bagi mereka yang menangguh kerjaya untuk menjaga keluarga. Cik Rahayu Mahzam dan Dr Intan Mokhtar cadangkan agar pakej SkillsFuture khas dibentuk bagi golongan wanita yang kembali bekerja.\n \nSatu lagi isu ialah jangkaan bahawa kaum wanita mesti berjaya bukan saja dalam kerjaya, tetapi sebagai ibu dan penjaga. Dalam hal ini, AP Darryl David menekankan pentingnya kaum bapa yang mahu berkongsi lebih banyak tanggungjawab keluarga, diberi sokongan demi membantu isteri mereka mencapai aspirasi masing-masing.\n \nUsul ini telah mendapat sokongan kedua-dua pihak di Dewan.

Two ministers \u2013 Chan Chun Sing and Masagos Zulkifli \u2013 spoke about this in Parliament yesterday. They explained why water is an existential issue for Singapore, and why this price increase is unavoidable. \n\nSingapore is an island, yet we are one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. We have enough water today only because of our unremitting efforts since independence. For us, water will always be a strategic resource, and a matter of national security. The Pioneer Generation knew this. So do the generations of servicemen and women who have defended Singapore. \n\nIn this situation, we have to price water properly. Then every time we turn on the tap, we are conscious of how precious each drop is. We last revised water prices in 1997 \u2013 a long time ago. Since then we have developed NEWater. We have also invested in desalination, which is cheaper than before but still expensive. We need to build more NEWater and desalination plants. That is why the cost of producing water has gone up, and tariffs must rise.\n\nWe should see the 30% increase in perspective. Many households will get additional U-Save rebates. So 1- and 2-room HDB households will not see any nett increase at all. For most other HDB flats, the nett increase will only be between $2 to $11 per month. For three quarters of businesses, water bills will go up by less than a $1 per day ($25 per month). Minister Masagos shared these in his speech (http:\/\/bit.ly\/2lVvdXs) yesterday.\n\nI hope this public debate reminds us how important and valuable water is, and how we can all help to conserve water, so that we always have enough water in Singapore. \u2013 LHL","status_type":"shared_story","story":null,"share_count":365.0},{"created_time":"2017-03-01T03:31:33.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1381767771885925","message":"\u201cThe world is a diverse place.

The fight was over the fundamental issue of Singapore\u2019s future: whether Singapore should be a non-Communist, democratic state, or a Communist one.\n\nMr Lee recalled in his obituary note on Mr Lim Chin Siong in February 1996 that his differences with Mr Lim were ideological and deep, but never personal. He would have said the same of Mr Fong. \n\nThey met for the last time in September 2009, at the launch of the book \u201cMen in White\u201d, a history of the PAP. The two shook hands warmly, and took a photo together.\n\nMy deepest condolences to Mrs Fong and family for their loss. \u2013 LHL\n\n(Mr Fong and Mr Lee during the book launch of \u201cMen in White\u201d in 2009. \/ ZB Photo \u00a9 Singapore Press Holdings Limited.

The main purpose of the elected President scheme is to give the President the mandate to decide on two major matters: reserves and appointments. \n\nThe President who safeguards reserves and men must have the right experience to decide whether the Government\u2019s budgets and spending proposals are sound and justified. He must also be able to judge character, motivation, integrity, ability of names put up, and to know what advice to seek and accept.\n\nThat is why candidates must meet the qualifying criteria before they stand for election as President. Candidates must have held key appointments in the public service like Speaker, Chief Justice, Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, or had experience in the private sector running large and complex companies like Singtel, DBS and Keppel Corp. The Constitution defines these as companies with $100mil paid up capital.\n\nBut this $100mil paid up capital criteria is out of date. When we set it 25 years ago, our economy was much smaller, and our reserves too. Now our economy has grown, government spending and reserves have increased.\n\nThe benchmark companies which we had in mind when setting the qualifying criteria have also grown much larger. Running a $100mil company is no longer commensurate with the responsibilities of the President, so we have to update the definition.\n\n#ndrsg","status_type":"mobile_status_update","story":null,"share_count":69.0},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T13:09:10.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183570795038958","message":"First, strengthening the role of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA).\n\nWhen we designed the system, we had in mind not just an elected President, the person elected by voters, but a President advised by a Council of Presidential Advisors.

The vote for the UK to leave the EU is already affecting the UK economy. But the bigger impact of the referendum was to deepen fault lines in British society. Why did it happen? Voters lost faith in their leaders and the whole political class. Large segments of the population felt that they were not benefitting from the country\u2019s progress.\n\nThe same thing can happen here. Can Singapore be different?

Terrorist groups are active all around us in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, the threat is not just from outside but also domestic. We have arrested a dozen Singaporeans who have been radicalised.\n\nLook at other countries. People react in two possible ways after an attack. One, they show a collective will to stand together. The other reaction is distrust and suspicion. The question is: which will happen in Singapore?\n\nOur diplomats and security forces, the Home Team and SAF are doing excellent work. But they alone cannot guarantee our security and safety, or hold us together. All of us must do our part, from understanding our national interest, and supporting Singapore in our relations with other countries, to preparing ourselves to deal with terrorism, and standing together after a terrorist attack.\n\nI will be launching the #SGSecure movement in September. It is a call-to-action to all to be sensitised, trained and mobilised to protect Singapore from a terrorist attack.\n\nUltimately, what matters most is our resolve to hold together and fight to defend our place in the world.\n\n#ndrsg\n\n(SPH Photo)","status_type":"added_photos","story":"Lee Hsien Loong with Ling Kin Huat and 4 others.","share_count":212.0},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T12:46:27.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183568048372566","message":"MALAYSIA & INDONESIA\n\nPM Lee: Malaysia and Indonesia are our two most important partners.

One current issue which may upset the peace, stability, and friendship of the region is the South China Sea. It is a complicated dispute.\n\nChina claims the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d. Four ASEAN countries \u2013 Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam \u2013 have overlapping claims with China and with one another. The US has no claims but they do have interests at stake.\n\n3 years ago, the Philippines launched a case against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Tribunal heard the case, and in its Award in July said that China\u2019s claim to historic rights within the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d is incompatible with UNCLOS. China has categorically rejected the Award as \u201cnull and void\u201d.\n\nWhat is Singapore\u2019s interest and stand? We don\u2019t have any claims of our own and we don\u2019t take sides on the specific claims of any of the claimants. But in other ways, we have a lot at stake. Three things matter to us:\n  - International law\n  - Freedom of Navigation\n  - A united ASEAN\n\nTherefore, on this South China Sea issue, we have our own principled and consistent stand. Other countries will persuade us to side with them but we have to choose our own place to stand, and not succumb to pressure.\n\nSingapore has a reputation to protect. We cooperate with other countries, but we make our own calculations. That is what makes us credible and valuable to others, to our ASEAN partners, and powers like the US, China and Europe. It has taken us a long time to build up this reputation, and we must be very careful to maintain it.\n\n#ndrsg","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":266.0},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T12:44:33.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183566558372715","message":"At the same time, Singapore is good friends with China and hopes that China will develop and grow well too.

Ucapan Bahasa Melayu \n\nDalam ucapan Bahasa Melayu, PM menekankan peri pentingnya masyarakat berbilang kaum Singapura untuk terus bersatu-padu.\n\nBeliau turut menggesa agar masyarakat Melayu\/Islam menguasai teknologi dan tidak lepaskan peluang untuk terlibat sepenuhnya dalam Ekonomi Baru. Beliau berharap masyarakat Melayu\/Islam akan merebut pelbagai peluang untuk meningkatkan kemahiran dan taraf kehidupan melalui SkillsFuture.\n\nPM juga menyentuh tentang ancaman keganasan yang semakin meruncing dan berbahaya di Singapura. Singapura terkenal sebagai negara yang berbilang agama dan rakyatnya bertolak ansur serta menghormati agama lain. Namun ada kalanya, pendakwah asing tidak faham konteks berbilang bangsa Singapura dan cuba memecahbelahkan keharmonian kaumnya. PM mengalu-alukan inisiatif masyarakat Melayu\/Islam untuk memperkukuhkan Skim Pengiktirafan Asatizah (ARS) dan menjadikannya wajib bagi semua asatizah di Singapura. PM menyambut baik usaha dan azam masyarakat Melayu\/Islam. Ini juga memberi jaminan dan meningkatkan keyakinan bahawa semua asatizah dapat membimbing pelajar mereka untuk mengamalkan Islam sesuai dengan konteks berbilang kaum Singapura.\n\nSebelum mengakhiri ucapannya, PM juga menarik perhatian kepada sistem Presiden Dipilih yang sedang diperhalusi untuk memberi peluang kepada kaum minoriti menjadi Presiden dari masa ke masa. Dengan keyakinan dan sokongan padu, barulah Presiden dapat melaksanakan peranan untuk menyatupadukan rakyat Singapura. \n\nMenggulung ucapannya, PM menekankan bahawa masyarakat Melayu\/Islam adalah anggota penting yang telah banyak menyumbang kepada kesejahteraan dan kemajuan Singapura. Beliau menyeru masyarakat Melayu supaya meraikan kepelbagaian dan bersatu hati supaya dapat terus menikmati keharmonian, kemajuan dan kemakmuran pada masa akan datang.  \n\nTonton video ucapan PM di sini: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2b9D7nE\n\n#ndrsg\n\n(Photos by MCI and PM Lee)","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":71.0},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T10:39:25.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183448525051185","message":"#FBLIVE: PM Lee Hsien Loong delivering his Malay and Chinese speeches at the National Day Rally 2016 at ITE College Central. \n\n#ndrsg","status_type":"added_video","story":"Lee Hsien Loong was live \u2014 at ITE College Central.","share_count":1171.0},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T10:25:15.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183514131711291","message":"Hi everyone \u2013 greetings from the PMO team! :)\n \nThe National Day Rally will start at 6.40pm.

So this BBC article on the inventor caught my attention and brought back memories. \n\nIt is an inspiring story of Lonnie Johnson, former NASA engineer and inventor. It tells how he invented not only the Super Soaker but also the Nerf toy gun, which were both hugely successful. He used his fortune in royalties to set up a scientific lab that is developing green batteries and a hydrogen powered engine.\n\nJohnson\u2019s story is especially remarkable, as he is an African American who grew up in the American South in the 1960s, when blacks were still discriminated against and downtrodden. But he had a natural sense of curiosity and a \u201cnever-say-die\u201d attitude, and he made it. \n\nHe also spoke of why we must expose the young to ideas, and let them experience success. This will foster self belief and grow more successes.\n\nSo let us celebrate small successes, have passion and keep doing what interests us. Keep trying, and if at first you fail, try again.

It reflects the anxiety of the British population over immigration, their resentment at having to negotiate with and accommodate European partners, and their desire to assert British identity and sovereignty. \n\nOther developed countries also face similar challenges as Britain. We all live in a globalised, interdependent world. The desire to disengage, to be less constrained by one\u2019s partners, to be free to do things entirely as one chooses, is entirely understandable. And yet in reality for many countries disengaging and turning inwards will likely lead to less security, less prosperity, and a dimmer future.\n\nThe next few years will be uncertain ones for Britain and Europe. Leaving the EU is as complicated as joining it. What new arrangements will be made? Will Brexit hurt investor confidence more broadly, and the global economy? How will Britain\u2019s leaving affect the rest of the EU? How will this affect us, living in Asia but part of the same globalised world?\n\nIt is too early to tell, but we need to watch developments carefully. Nobody can foresee all the consequences of the Brexit. \n\nThe British voters have decided. We wish Britain well. I wish David Cameron well too, who has been a good friend of Singapore and has announced his intention to resign as PM.\n\nSingapore will continue to cultivate our ties with Britain, which is a long standing friend and partner.

I enjoy reading, but read less than I would like for pleasure. It is partly finding time, and also (if the book is serious) the effort of focussing on something not work related. But recently I have read several good books:\n\nAri Shavit\u2019s My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel, tells the story of Israel\u2019s nation building and the conflict with the Palestinians through personal stories.\n\nOperation Thunderbolt, by Saul David, is about the spectacular Israeli commando raid on Entebbe airport in Uganda, to rescue hostages after an aircraft hijacking, which happened exactly 40 years ago.\n\nA Rage for Order, by Robert Worth, is about the Arab Spring, and how things have gone since then. Also told through personal stories, it brings home vividly the passions and struggles that combined to cause the upheavals in the Middle East.\n\nI read these books partly because of my April trip to Jordan, Israel, and the Palestine Territories.\n\nHaving just been on holiday in Japan, and visited the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimyo (warlord) who unified Japan and founded the Tokugawa shogunate, I am now starting on a biography of him. Shogun, the Life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by A L Sadler, was published long ago in 1937, but promises a fascinating read.\n\nThe National Library Board, Singapore encourages Singaporeans to read more, read widely and read together.

But it is good for children to learn through exploration and risk taking, and to take a few tumbles in the process. They will grow up more confident and resilient, better able to cope with unfamiliar or difficult situations. \n\nI asked the Housing & Development Board about this, because HDB builds many playgrounds in our housing estates. HDB tells me that they are trying out more interesting designs, like a forest-themed playground in Bukit Panjang, and a military-inspired design in Choa Chu Kang (where Keat Hong Camp used to be).

With the global economy slowing down, many workers are worried and anxious. This is an issue in Singapore too, with retrenchment a reality for some. We are watching this closely, and have measures to help workers retrain and find new jobs. \n\nOne scheme is the Career Support Programme (CSP), proposed by Minister Lim Swee Say. The CSP provides wage support for a year, to defray hiring costs and encourage employers to try hiring PMETs who have been retrenched mid-career, and hopefully employ them longer-term. \n\nAnother measure is to help our workers upgrade and uplift themselves. Secretary General Chan Chun Sing told me NTUC intends to raise $50 million to partner universities to teach new skills to mid-career workers, including PMETs. I told him if he can raise $50 million, the government will write the cheque for another $150 million, for a total of $200 million in the NTUC-Education and Training Fund. NTUC will start by partnering with NTU, with more universities later down the road.  \n\nIn these are times of rapid change, we must take our challenges seriously, but we should have confidence. The Government and Labour Movement are ready, and with the people\u2019s support for our programmes, we can emerge stronger than before. \n\nClick here to view my May Day Rally Speech: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1W0F8aW \u2013 LHL\n\n#mdrsg\n#CareFairGrow","status_type":"added_photos","story":"Lee Hsien Loong added 4 new photos to the album: May Day Rally 2016.","share_count":237.0},{"created_time":"2016-05-01T02:00:00.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1106802896049082","message":"UPDATE: The May Day Rally is over.

One point she made struck me: quite apart from financial incentives and practical considerations, a country\u2019s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) depends also on historical and social factors, which are often not well understood. \n\nShe gave the example of France, which has a TFR of 2.0 \u2014 one of the highest among developed countries. France has good social policies to support and encourage parenthood. But when Josephine visited France to study their experience, all the people she met gave one more explanation: \"1945\". France lost so many of its citizens in the Second World War (600,000 dead) that after the War ended in 1945, there was a strong desire - a national psyche - to repopulate the nation.\n\nThe TFR is a statistic, but it is made up of countless individual stories. I was reminded of the late Congressman Tom Lantos whom I met years ago. He was a Hungarian Jew and Holocaust survivor. He lost most of his family in the concentration camps. After the War, he emigrated to the US and became a Congressman. He had two daughters and 18 grandchildren. His daughters decided to give him as many grandchildren as they could, to make up for the family members killed.\n\nSingapore is fortunate not to have experienced such calamities. Our TFR was 1.25 last year. We should do all we can to encourage couples to have more kids. Hence the enhancements to paternity leave, shared parental leave, and adoption leave that Josephine announced. They come into effect next year, so if you are thinking of having a baby (or another baby), now is the time to start trying! :) - LHL\n\n#SGBudget2016\n\n(Families enjoying a day out at Marina Barrage \/ Photo by me)","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":292.0},{"created_time":"2016-04-14T01:00:00.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1095017853894253","message":"\u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd!\n\nToday is the Tamil New Year.

Mr S Rajaratnam recruited him to join the PAP. KC fought in the 1959 elections and won, thus beginning his long career in politics and the Public Service. \n \nMr Lee Kuan Yew once described KC as a man who \u201chad it\u201d \u2014 a man of courage that did not melt under pressure. In the early 1960s when the PAP was battling pro-communist factions in the party, the pro-communists targeted KC. He received a letter with a bullet, a death threat. In 1961, thousands of Chinese school students staged sit-ins. They threw rotten apples at him and shouted, \u201c\u674e\u70af\u624d, \u8fdb\u68fa\u6750 (Lee Khoon Choy, enter the coffin)!\u201d KC did not buckle. He stood with the PAP and was loyal till the end.\n \nKC also served as Ambassador and High Commissioner to eight countries. As Ambassador to Indonesia, he played a crucial role in thawing relations between Singapore and Indonesia. Singapore had hanged two Indonesian commandos who bombed MacDonald House in 1965 and killed innocent civilians. KC persuaded Mr Lee Kuan Yew to wear a batik shirt and scatter flowers at the graves of the two men in Jakarta. This conciliatory gesture enabled Mr Lee to establish a relationship with President Suharto. In recognition of his contributions, KC was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1990.  \n\nAfter KC stepped down from public service, he returned to his first love \u2014 writing and painting. I was honoured to launch his book \u201cGolden Dragon and Purple Phoenix\u201d in 2013. \n\nKC believed that \u201cevery human being should know his own roots. A tree without roots cannot grow. Human beings are the same.\u201d Indeed, as we remember his life, we remember our roots and what our pioneers like him did, to put Singapore on the path it is today. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. \u2013 LHL\n \n[At the launch of Mr Lee Khoon Choy\u2019s (far right) book \u201cGolden Dragon and Purple Phoenix\u201d in July 2013. \/ ST Photo \u00a9 Singapore Press Holdings Limited.

So I was happy to launch the new Master Plan today, to build a new SGH to serve future generations. \n\nAmidst the new buildings we will preserve links to the past. The Bowyer block (in pic, with clock tower), built in 1926, will be at the centre of the new campus. It will be an icon to honour those who have given their lives to public healthcare, and to remind us of how SGH has been treating patients for two centuries. \n\nRevamping the SGH campus will take 20 years of hard work.

Our political system is working now. But we must keep updating it to continue to have a high quality government in the longer term \u2013 one that is honest, competent and effective, that is always accountable to the electorate, and that upholds a multi-racial society.\n\nIn Parliament today, I announced 3 things we will do to ensure this:\n\nFirst, we will increase the minimum number of opposition MPs, including Non-Constituency MPs, from 9 to 12 by the next election. We will also give them the same voting rights as MPs. This will in effect aid the opposition, giving their best losers more exposure and possibly building them up for the next round. But I believe this will be good for the government and good for Singapore. No ruling party and government should ever be afraid of open argument. Ultimately, Singapore will benefit from a contest of ideas.\n\nSecond, we will further reduce the average size of Group Representation Constituencies, and create more Single Member Constituencies. The GRC scheme ensures that we will always have at least a minimum number of minority race MPs in Parliament. But we have to find the right balance between big and small GRCs, and the right mix of GRCs and SMCs.\n\nThird, we will review the elected President scheme \u2014 to keep the eligibility criteria up to date, to strengthen the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA) which assists and advises the President, and to ensure that minorities have a chance to be elected President.\n\nYou can view my full speech here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/20stbdh\n\n- LHL","status_type":"added_video","story":null,"share_count":2160.0},{"created_time":"2016-01-27T09:40:20.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1040112629384776","message":"Speech at Parliamentary debate on President\u2019s Address","status_type":"created_note","story":"Lee Hsien Loong published a note.","share_count":298.0},{"created_time":"2016-01-27T05:37:08.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1040065156056190","message":"Off to Parliament for the debate on the President\u2019s Address.

He fought to keep British forces in Singapore as long as possible. \n\nThe British bent over backwards to help us. British regulations required them to destroy surplus equipment, but Healey agreed to let us have their surplus equipment when British forces left Singapore. \n\nHealey also sold us the Hawker Hunter aircraft, and helped train our air force to operate and fly our first fighters. \n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew described Healey as having a powerful intellect, \u201clike a computer which kept on putting out new solutions as more data was fed in\u201d. He later became the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was described as \u201cthe best Prime Minister Britain never had\u201d. \n\nMy deepest condolences to his family on his passing. \u2013 LHL \n\n(Denis Healey sitting down for dinner with my father in 1966, in their first meeting in Singapore to discuss British defence spending. \/ ST File Photo \u00a9 Singapore Press Holdings Limited.

The Fresh Start Housing Scheme will help second-timer rental households own a 2-room flat. The flat will have a shorter lease and stricter conditions on resale.

2015\n\n\u201cOur Family\u201d\n\nChinese New Year is a time to celebrate with our families. It is a time to reflect on the blessings of having a family \u2013 to thank our elders for what they have done for us, to appreciate our spouses, to shower love on our children. It is a time to enjoy the simple goodness of family.   \n\nSo even if we may be busy, travelling or living in far flung lands, unable to come together physically for the New Year reunion, let us make the effort to connect with one another. On this most important festival in the lunar calendar, let us pause and remind ourselves of what truly matters in life, of what it means to belong to a family.   \n\nThe Government is doing all it can to help people build strong families. We are encouraging couples to have more children. The Marriage and Parenthood Package will support them, as will more affordable childcare and pre-schools. This year, we look forward to celebrating the birth of many Jubilee babies. We are encouraging three-generation families to stay close-knit, and making it easier for young couples setting up home to live close to their parents, through targeted housing grants. The Pioneer Generation Package, Silver Support and MediShield Life will lighten the burden on families taking care of elderly parents.  \n\nBeyond our immediate family and relatives, we should also strengthen our larger national family. Singaporeans need to take care of one another, and especially of fellow citizens who are vulnerable or less fortunate.  We are strengthening our social safety nets. We have made it easier for low-income families to own their homes, introduced MediShield Life to give more protection against large hospital bills, reviewed CPF Life to help families better prepare for retirement, and expanded Workfare to support low-income workers and their families. The state and the community are bearing more risk on behalf of individuals, to give those who need help more peace of mind.  We are all in this together.  \n\nWe are doing all this to help our families stay together, not to supplant the role that families play. Our family ties must not weaken, unlike what we have seen in other societies where the state has taken on more responsibility. We must not let this happen in Singapore \u2013 either to our individual families, or to our larger national family. \n\nStrong families are the bedrock of our society. Family members not only take care of each other. They laugh and cry together.  Every member is shaped by every other. Our families inspire us to be better, not just for ourselves but for each other.

He helped new residents to settle in, tackled the many teething problems like public transport and defects in the new HDB flats, and made sure their needs were looked after. \n \nHe was one of the Chinese educated MPs who kept us close to the Chinese ground. Others like him were Yeo Toon Chia, Ho Kah Leong, and Chng Jit Koon. Many were Nantah graduates, like Dr Koh. One difficult decision they had to make was to support the reforms in the late 1970s that merged Nantah with NUS, and led eventually to the formation of NTU. \n \nToday we no longer have \u201cChinese educated\u201d MPs, but many MPs speak Mandarin as a result of our bilingual policy.

This was not because her high score of 261 allowed her entry into any school of her choice, but because she had already made up her mind to apply for Evergreen Secondary School, a neighbourhood school that was next to her home.\n \nThis time last year, Wei Ling\u2019s teachers and school mates thought she was \u201cwasting\u201d her chances but both she and her father, Mr Goh Poh Ling, a 68-year old taxi driver, thought it was a \u201cworthwhile\u201d choice.\n \nMr Goh said that his daughter could have gone to any school, but this one was the closest to home, and thus the most suitable. \u201cIf she went to a school further away, the journey there would have taken at least one hour, and a return trip would be two hours. That would have amounted to 730 hours in a year. Who would find the time to do their school work?\u201d \n \nFrom her home in Woodlands Street 83, Wei Ling, who is now in Secondary One, takes just 5 minutes to walk to school everyday. The time she saves on traveling is spent on school work and with her family. \u201cLights out\u201d is at 9.30pm and her family life is disciplined and healthy. \n \nWei Ling said, \u201cRather than a school\u2019s name or reputation, what matters more to my parents are good moral values. Every day, I spend most of my time with my family, and not on travelling. Ever since I was in Primary Four, I had already wanted to attend Evergreen and it is better than what I imagined.\u201d\n \nWei Ling\u2019s elder brother graduated from Evergreen, and was the school\u2019s head prefect. He did well in his \u2018O\u2019 Levels, scoring eight A1s. Mr Goh related with pride how his children did not receive any tuition, as he could neither afford the fees nor the time. \u201cFor me, nothing is more important than a good upbringing, and the neighbourhood schools are not bad. If the child works hard, they can achieve good results, too. I am not from the Ministry of Education, but I believe that every school is a good school.\u201d \n \nBrand name schools are attractive, but in the eyes of Mr Goh, what is more important is the sort of environment that suits the child. \n \n\u201cIf the child has the ability, they can go anywhere. Brand name schools are good, but the competition there is also strong. You may be first elsewhere, but be pushed down by the tougher environment. As parents, we should not let our children feel belittled. Instead, let them feel empowered. I will not insist that my children become doctors. Whatever she chooses to do, I will support as long as her heart is set on it.\u201d\n \nWei Ling added that while many people may feel that neighbourhood schools are not as good, she disagrees. \u201cI like Evergreen Secondary School very much and I have learnt a lot about life and being a better person here.\u201d\n \nParent wants his child to be less tired\n \nSiti Nurjaslina Bte Jeffry, 13, also performed well at last year\u2019s PSLE. She chose to go to Fuhua Secondary School. Not only is it near her home, she was also attracted to their shooting CCA.\n \nEven though she did not make it to the CCA, Siti was not disappointed as there were many other interesting CCAs she could choose from, and she now enjoys being part of the Malay Cultural Group. \n \nSiti\u2019s father, Mr Jufri, a 44-year-old technician, said, \u201cLife is already stressful in Singapore. I hope my children will not be too stressed. Her results could have gotten her into a brand name school, but she will be very tired. I don\u2019t want her to be worn out. When you are under pressure, it will also be difficult to make friends and enjoy their friendship.\u201d","status_type":"shared_story","story":null,"share_count":858.0},{"created_time":"2014-12-20T10:00:33.000Z","id":"125845680811480_823864684342906","message":"I visited the Battle for Merger exhibition in October. This was the book of Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s radio talks in 1961, explaining what the fight against the Communists was about, and why Singapore needed Merger with Malaya. \n\nThe Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) was a violent, illegal organisation. So it operated secretly, underground. But the Communists infiltrated open, legal organisations like trade unions, student associations and political parties. These supported the Communist cause, but denied that they themselves were Communist. Mr Lee exposed this Communist united front tactic.\n\nI took these photos of a fascinating exhibit: a pair of original handwritten documents. One was a trade union document, signed \u6797\u6e05\u7965 Lim Chin Siong. He was the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the main open front political party. The other was a Communist study cell document, signed \u738b\u660e Wang Ming. The handwriting was identical. In fact Wang Ming was Lim Chin Siong\u2019s party name; Communist cadres took party names to conceal their real identities. So Lim Chin Siong was a Communist, and the Barisan Sosialis was Communist controlled.\n\nThis was more than 50 years ago. Many old Communist and pro-Communist activists have reconciled with their past, and become good citizens. But a few hard core ones still deny these historical facts. They don\u2019t want to admit that they had fought on the wrong side, and that luckily for Singapore they lost. Some \u201crevisionist\u201d historians make this argument too. One motivation: cast doubt on the legitimacy of the PAP government, not just in the 1960s, but today.\n\nThe British have been declassifying documents from their archives in London, and making them available to the public. Also senior CPM leaders like Chin Peng, Eu Chooi Yip, Fong Chong Pik (aka the Plen) and others have published memoirs. Their first person accounts, like the British documents, confirm the extent of the Communist united front in Singapore, and leave no doubt that the Barisan was formed at the instigation of the CPM, and that Lim Chin Siong was a Communist cadre.\n\nWe have put together an account using evidence from the British archives as well as CPM sources, which confirm that Mr Lee Kuan Yew told the truth. Here it is, for your weekend reading. http:\/\/bit.ly\/16BGul3 \u2013 LHL\n\n#iremembersg\n\n(Photo by me)","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":256.0},{"created_time":"2014-12-19T09:58:48.000Z","id":"125845680811480_823366554392719","message":"(MCI Photo by LH Goh)","status_type":"added_photos","story":"Lee Hsien Loong updated their profile picture.","share_count":267.0},{"created_time":"2014-12-19T09:58:58.000Z","id":"125845680811480_823366904392684","message":"Christmas Wonderland @ Gardens by the Bay.

Later, he commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade, and became a mentor to generations of SAF officers.\n\nAfter retirement, he was the President of the SAF Veterans\u2019 League. \n\nI worked under John as a young SAF officer. When I joined the General Staff, he was one of the senior commanders we worked closely with. So I was happy to see him do this video for the Pioneer Generation Package.\n\nWithout John and his generation of officers, we would not have today\u2019s SAF.

In 1961, Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave 12 radio talks, telling the inside story of the fight between the non-Communists and Communists, and explaining to Singaporeans what was at stake. Later he published the talks as a book, The Battle for Merger. The book has just been republished; hence the exhibition.\n\nThe radio talks were a crucial move in winning the hearts and minds of the people. It led to Singapore joining Malaysia, then Separation and today\u2019s independent Singapore. Had Mr Lee and the non-Communist side lost, our history would have been totally different. \n\nMr Lee worked very very hard to write and deliver the talks. I remember the \u201cfamily holiday\u201d in Cameron Highlands in August 1961, which we took so that my father could compose the talks away from the day to day pressures in Singapore. His secretary came with us, and there were multiple drafts and redrafts all over the flat in Cluny Lodge. \n\nI also remember following my father to Radio Singapore to record the talks. He broadcast 12 talks, in 3 languages, making a total of 36 broadcasts in just one month. Now that I have done my own talks and speeches, and know how much work goes into a single short broadcast, e.g. the National Day Message, I understand what a superhuman effort this was.\n\nThe subject was serious, but Mr Lee presented it simply and vividly. Singaporeans listened to the broadcasts eagerly. When the book came out, I read it, fascinated. I still have my old copy. It still reads like a thriller today.\n\nAfter more than 50 years, Singapore has changed enormously, and vastly for the better. Most of today\u2019s Singaporeans were born long after the broadcasts.

Ucapan Bahasa Melayu \n\nDalam ucapan Bahasa Melayunya, PM telah mengulangi penghargaannya kepada golongan Perintis Melayu.\n\nEncik Lee menekankan bahawa warga Perintis Melayu sebenarnya ada pilihan (samada untuk menyertai Malaysia atau kekal di Singapura) apabila Singapura Merdeka. Tetapi mereka memilih untuk jatuh-bangun bersama Singapura sehingga negara ini mekar menjadi sebuah masyarakat berbilang kaum dan agama yang unik \u2013 yang bersatu padu dan harmoni. Beliau mengulangi penghargaannya kepada golongan Perintis Melayu kerana yakin dengan masa depan Singapura dan bertungkus-lumus dengan kaum lain, membangunkan Singapura.\n\nSalah seorang tokoh Perintis Melayu cemerlang yang disebut PM ialah Encik Yusof Ishak, Presiden pertama Singapura. PM mengumumkan 3 bentuk penghargaan sebagai menjunjung budi dan pengorbanan Encik Yusof kepada Negara:\n\nPertama, sebuah masjid baru di Woodlands akan dinamakan \u201cMasjid Yusof Ishak\u201d.\n\nKedua, Institut Pengajian Asia Tenggara bakal dikenali sebagai \u201cISEAS \u2013 Institut Yusof Ishak\u201d. \n\nKetiga, NUS akan memulakan \u201cKerusi Profesor Yusof Ishak dalam Sains Sosial\u201d. \n\nDalam ucapannya, PM turut menarik perhatian tentang kemajuan besar yang dicatat masyarakat Melayu\/Islam sepanjang 50 tahun lalu. Ini ketara melalui contoh-contoh individu Melayu\/Islam yang berjaya saban tahun. \n\nPM juga menarik perhatian tentang penekanan pemerintah untuk menghargai setiap individu berdasarkan sumbangannya dan bukan hanya kelayakannya. PM mengumumkan pembentukan Jawatankuasa ASPIRE yang akan bantu rakyat menggilap potensi mereka melalui pembelajaran sepanjang hayat dan latihan kemahiran khususnya buat pelajar ITE dan politeknik. Ini agar setiap rakyat berpeluang untuk majukan diri dan perbaiki kehidupan mereka.\n\nMenggulung ucapannya, PM yakin masyarakat Melayu\/Islam akan mencatat kejayaan demi kejayaan jika mereka terus bersatu-padu. PM menyeru agar masyarakat Melayu\/Islam menjunjung semangat golongan Perintis, perkukuh masyarakat berbilang kaum kita dan memperteguh komitmen untuk membentuk Singapura yang lebih baik buat semua.  \n\n#ndrsg\n\n(Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore, Yusof Ishak Collection)","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":159.0},{"created_time":"2014-08-17T10:30:17.000Z","id":"125845680811480_760126034050105","message":"Hi everyone (from the PMO team)!

I am heartened by the general support for Budget 2014. \n \nYesterday and today, Gan Kim Yong and Chan Chun Sing explained how we are strengthening social safety nets so that no one gets left behind. One key initiative is MediShield Life, which will cover every Singaporean, throughout his or her life.\n\nPremiums for MediShield Life will be affordable for all, especially the elderly and the low-income. \n \nThe Govt will bear most of the initial costs of universal coverage under MediShield Life. We will also introduce permanent subsidies for lower- to middle-income groups. For those who despite this help can\u2019t afford their remaining share of premiums, Medifund will provide additional assistance. \n \nAfter all the subsidies, most households should be able to pay their MediShield premiums using just half of their Medisave contributions. \n\nLower- to middle-income households should pay either the same or less premiums for MediShield Life as they are paying for MediShield today. \n\nThe Pioneer Generation will be fine too. Effectively, those aged 80 and above today will have their premiums fully covered. Younger Pioneers (aged 65 \u2013 79) on MediShield today will pay half of current premiums, but get better coverage. \n \nMediShield Life depends on everyone chipping in to share the burden, to take collective responsibility to protect one another.

This evening I met community and religious leaders, together with some Ministers and MPs, for a candid and fruitful dialogue. Snapped this pic of the participants at the end \u2013 all in good spirits! \n\nI told the group that I fully appreciate their desire to allow Muslim women in uniform to wear the tudung. But a larger issue is at stake: the sort of society we aspire to be. Singapore is a multi-racial, multi-religious and harmonious society. Minorities are fully integrated into the mainstream, but have full opportunities to maintain their identities and practise their faiths. So I am also mindful how crucial it is for us to strengthen our cohesion, and maintain the relaxed confidence and trust that benefits us all, especially the minorities.\n\nOn the tudung issue, the position is not frozen. Attitudes will shift and arrangements will get updated. We have gradually evolved over the last decade. Many statutory boards now have uniforms that allow Muslim staff to wear the tudung, e.g., LTA, NEA. In 5, 10 years\u2019 time, I am confident that we will not be in the same situation as today.\n\nIt is best that we continue evolving gradually and carefully. The racial harmony we enjoy is not perfect, but it is more precious and more fragile than we think. Let\u2019s work hard to strengthen it, so that all races can live happily together as one united people. \u2013 LHL\n\nIsu tudung adalah isu penting bagi ramai orang Islam di Singapura. Petang tadi saya dan beberapa Menteri serta Anggota Parlimen telah bertemu dengan wakil-wakil masyarakat dan pemimpin agama. Perbincangan kami berlangsung secara terus terang, dan dari hati ke hati. Lihat gambar para peserta yang saya petik di akhir sesi \u2013 semuanya dalam semangat muhibbah! \n\nSaya tekankan kepada para peserta bahawa saya akur hasrat mereka untuk membenarkan wanita Islam di sektor seragam memakai tudung. Tetapi isu lebih besar harus difikirkan: Apakah bentuk masyarakat yang kita inginkan? \n\nSingapura adalah sebuah masyarakat berbilang bangsa dan agama yang harmoni. Kaum minoriti sebati dengan masyarakat lebih besar tetapi memiliki peluang sepenuhnya untuk kekalkan identiti dan amalkan agama masing-masing. Jadi saya sedar betapa gentingnya untuk memperkukuh ikatan kita bersama dan mengekalkan keyakinan dan kepercayaan yang mendatangkan manfaat untuk kita semua, lebih-lebih lagi kaum minoriti.\n\nDalam isu tudung, keadaan yang kita lihat hari ini tidak akan kekal begini. Sikap akan berubah dan dikemaskinikan. Sepanjang sedekad lalu, ada kemajuan yang bertahap dalam isu ini. Kini, banyak badan berkanun membenarkan kakitangan mereka memakai tudung bersama pakaian seragam misalnya LTA, NEA. Dalam 5, 10 tahun lagi, saya yakin keadaan akan berubah, tidak seperti hari ini. \n\nSebaiknya kita terus bergerak secara bertahap dan berhati-hati. Sesungguhnya keharmonian kaum yang kita nikmati tidak sempurna, ia sebenarnya lebih rapuh dan berharga dari apa yang kita sedari. \n\nAyuh kita berusaha gigih untuk memperkukuhkannya supaya semua kaum boleh hidup bersama-sama dengan selesa sebagai satu warga yang bersatu-padu. - LHL","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":488.0},{"created_time":"2014-01-24T13:39:40.000Z","id":"125845680811480_649436095119100","message":"Singapore is turning 50 next year.

They are too many to answer individually, but I want to address some of the key themes.\n\nMany tweeted about stress in the education system (e.g. @Joshyy_Tingg, @RovinNation, @ShaeAtSix). Richard Chan and Benny Chee wrote about the need to do more in terms of values, ethics and social awareness. I understand these concerns. But we do need to study and work hard, to give ourselves the best start in life. We are making every school a good school, and providing every student with many paths through the education system. But there is a lot of competition to get into the most popular schools. Some competition is good, but too much becomes counter-productive. \n\nStudents, parents and teachers must not lose sight of what education is about. Yesterday, Heng Swee Keat outlined MOE\u2019s plans to continue providing values-driven, holistic education, to help every student achieve success in his own way, at his own pace (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1bFvVO3). But whether this reduces stress depends also on our attitudes towards success and examinations. \n\nSeveral of you worried about housing affordability (e.g., @ZeeFriday, Zack Drz, Siu Lin). Housing is becoming more affordable, because we have increased grants for lower- and middle-income families, and are building more flats. We will track this closely and do more if necessary to keep HDB flats always within reach of Singaporeans.\n\n@hpility asked if being Prime Minister is stressful. I suppose sometimes it is, just like any other job. But it is a great honour for me to serve.

Relocating the airbase will also remove height restrictions on a large area around Paya Lebar, and allow us to redevelop eastern Singapore in new and exciting ways.

As I said in my ND Message, Singapore is at a turning point and needs to find a new way forward together. The economy is maturing and our population is ageing. Different groups in society have more diverse, even conflicting, interests. Older people worry about healthcare and costs of living. Younger ones aspire to wider education opportunities and more affordable homes. So we need to reassess our position, review our direction, and refresh our strategies. We have already started adjusting policies to achieve our goal: a fair and just society. \n\nHere are some videos on the changes in housing, education and healthcare.

It was a special occasion, because both have been with GIC since it was first formed in 1981. They have contributed much to Singapore \u2013 overseeing and managing our reserves through booms and crashes, growing them steadily year by year, and mentoring generations of younger officers. \r\n\r\nRichard was the first private sector member of the GIC Board. After he retired from Shell Singapore, he became the Managing Director of GIC (and MAS concurrently), before serving as Finance Minister. He continued serving on the GIC Board even after he retired from politics. He was widely respected for building up GIC and for his humble and fair disposition. \r\n\r\nKok Song was GIC\u2019s Chief Investment Officer. He was a key person, almost an institution, in GIC. He could have done well for himself elsewhere, but chose to stay in GIC because he found meaning and satisfaction in working for the nation, for a greater cause than a typical bank or fund manager. Besides his work in GIC, Kok Song also chaired the Wealth Management Institute and served on the Singapore Labour Foundation.\r\n\r\nMany others like Richard and Kok Song work quietly out of the public eye, making Singapore a better place for us all with their talents and energies. They deserve our support and gratitude. \r\n\r\nI thank them both for all they have done for GIC, and wish them a long and contented retirement. - LHL\r\n\r\n(MCI Photo by Kenji Soon)","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":63.0},{"created_time":"2013-01-17T01:20:29.000Z","id":"125845680811480_464933423569369","message":"Did my MPS last night. We compiled a profile of all the MPS cases we handled in Teck Ghee over the last year, which I thought you might find interesting. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, we served nearly 2,800 residents (many of whom came more than once) and wrote over 5,500 letters of appeal, or more than 100 letters per week. Just under half the cases live in Teck Ghee itself, while the rest were from other parts of Ang Mo Kio GRC. More than half were older residents (aged 46 or older). Half live in 3-room flats, mirroring the housing profile of our estate. But I had a sprinkling (3%) from private estates too \u2013 these residents are generally able to handle problems themselves, though once in a while they too find they need their MP.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent appeals (more than a third) concerned housing, e.g. buying\/selling flats or requests for rental flats. HDB has a tough job, but it is making progress building more BTO flats and shortening waiting times for rental flats. \r\n\r\nOther common appeals were for financial assistance (14%, including social assistance, or help with paying bills), followed by immigration matters (12%, including citizenship & PR, employment or social visit passes), and traffic\/parking issues (9% of letters, mostly appealing against summonses). Education appeals (4%) popped up seasonally, especially during school or university \/ poly \/ ITE admissions season. \r\n\r\nFortunately, we encountered not many requests for help to find jobs (3%) reflecting our low unemployment. Nor were there were many requests for help with medical bills (only 82 cases throughout the whole year, less than 2%), though I know that people worry a lot about healthcare costs and we will continue to monitor them closely. \r\n\r\nWe always seek to give residents a full and sympathetic hearing, and to help them as best as we can. Even if we can\u2019t fully solve all their problems, we can often at least lessen them. I always feel encouraged when residents come to thank us, like this one who brought me a special thank you card. I had written for Mr Koh Chek Heng to NUH a few weeks ago, and obtained a medical report which he needed to show to several government agencies. \u2013 LHL","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":73.0},{"created_time":"2013-01-16T01:07:23.000Z","id":"125845680811480_464500193612692","message":"The Singapore skyline.

It is good that we are rethinking the balance in our National Conversation, but we must not go overboard and abandon values and principles that have served us well, and remain vital to us. \u2013 LHL\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/peoples-action-party\/excerpts-from-speech-by-pap-secretary-general-lee-hsien-loong-at-2012-party-conf\/534898993188172","status_type":"added_photos","story":null,"share_count":45.0},{"created_time":"2012-12-01T03:51:20.000Z","id":"125845680811480_415643768502114","message":"This week, the UN recognised Palestine as a \u201cnon-member observer state\u201d.

Both Mr Lee and the Sri Begawan negotiated to join Malaysia, and became friends. In the end Singapore joined, but Brunei stayed out. Today we are both independent countries.\n\nThis special friendship has endured and deepened. One area of cooperation is defence. Generations of SAF servicemen have done jungle training at Temburong, climbing Mount Biang and crossing Sungai Batu Apoi.

Millions of Muslims have gathered in the holy city of Mecca. Unfortunately, this year Saudi Arabia accepted fewer pilgrims, as it is redeveloping the area around two Holy Mosques. Singapore\u2019s Haj quota was also reduced, even though I wrote to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to request more places. I hope that those who were unable to go this year will get the chance to do so before too long.\n\nMuslims also perform the Korban (sacrifice) today, to celebrate Prophet Ibrahim\u2019s faith in God. Min Yaacob Ibrahim and I were initially quite worried that our Korban ritual might be affected by Australia\u2019s stringent new regulations on live sheep exports. Fortunately 16 mosques passed the Australian audits, and were able to import 2,500 sheep for the ceremony. \n\nWhen I met Australian PM Julia Gillard in Canberra recently, I thanked her for her government\u2019s help on this matter. She told me that her government wants to continue exporting live animals. But I know that Australian animal welfare groups are pressing strongly to ban live exports completely, as New Zealand has done. We should be prepared for this possibility, and work out alternative arrangements in future.\n\nI wish all Muslims well during this holy day. \u2013 LHL\n\nSalam Aidiladha kepada semua umat Islam Singapura!\n\nSemasa musim haji ini, jutaan umat Islam dari seluruh dunia berkumpul di kota suci Mekah. Malangnya, tahun ini, kerajaan Arab Saudi menghadkan bilangan jemaah dari luar negara kerana projek pembangunan semula di kawasan Tanah Suci. Kuota haji Singapura juga turut terjejas, walaupun saya telah menulis kepada Putera Mahkota Arab Saudi untuk merayu kuota tambahan. Saya berharap bahawa mereka yang tidak dapat menunaikan haji mereka tahun ini akan mendapat peluang untuk berbuat demikian tidak lama lagi.\n\nHari ini juga umat Islam mengerjakan korban untuk memperingati ketaatan Nabi Ibrahim kepada Tuhan. Saya dan Menteri Yaacob Ibrahim pada mulanya khuatir ibadah korban akan terjejas tahun ini sempena peraturan pemerintah Australia yang lebih ketat ke atas eksport binatang. Mujurlah, 16 masjid lulus pemeriksaan audit Australia dan berjaya mengimport 2,500 ekor kambing untuk dikorbankan.\n\nKetika bertemu PM Australia Julia Gillard di Canberra baru-baru ini, saya mengucapkan terima kasih kepada beliau atas bantuan pemerintah beliau mengenai perkara ini. Dia memberitahu saya bahawa pemerintah Australia mahu terus mengeksport ternakan hidup. Namun, saya tahu bahawa kumpulan-kumpulan hak asasi haiwan telah menggesa pemerintah Australia supaya mengharam sepenuhnya eksport ternakan hidup seperti apa yang dilakukan oleh New Zealand. Kita perlu bersedia menghadapi kemungkinan ini dan mencari alternatif jika ia berlaku.\n\nSaya ingin mengucapkan yang terbaik bagi semua umat Islam pada hari suci ini. \u2013 LHL","status_type":"mobile_status_update","story":null,"share_count":75.0},{"created_time":"2012-10-24T17:27:42.000Z","id":"125845680811480_428807620515283","message":"Just came home from my Meet-The-People session in Teck Ghee. We had 114 cases tonight, about our usual number, both from Teck Ghee and the rest of Ang Mo Kio GRC. \n\nA fair share were residents with housing problems. But the root cause is family breakups. One resident I saw was locked out of his marital home years back, recently divorced, and has transferred the flat to his ex-wife. Another recent divorcee is having to sell her flat, leaving her and her teenage daughter to fend for themselves, with no other relatives here to fall back on. Both asked me for HDB rental flats. I often receive such messages through Facebook too.\n\nFamily breakups lead to so many other problems: housing, financial difficulties, custody of children, etc. MPs do our best to help, and HDB is building more rental flats.

Also learnt much about Maori culture and history at the Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand.\n\nToday I wrapped up my visit with a tour of our Navy frigate the RSS Stalwart that is in harbour in Wellington. The weather was chilly, but we had a warm time on board, meeting the crew, plus other Singaporeans living here who were also visiting the ship.

Entitled \u201cSins of Their Founders\u201d, the piece reviews a book on the civil war in Sri Lanka. The civil war started in 1983, but as Dhume pointed out its roots go back to the country\u2019s independence in 1948. Instead of embracing an inclusive view of citizenship, Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) marginalised the Tamil minority. The Tamil revolt was led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, a brutal guerrilla leader. The bloody conflict killed tens of thousands, and set the country back many years. Now that it is over, I hope Sri Lanka can enjoy lasting peace and stability.\n\nDhume noted that Singapore took a different path, with a different result. We are fortunate that right from the birth of our nation, our founders upheld multi-racialism and equal opportunity as the fundamental basis for our society. Thus we have maintained harmony between the different races and religions all these years. But we must never take this harmony as given, and must continue to work hard together to uphold and strengthen it. \u2013 LHL","status_type":"shared_story","story":null,"share_count":74.0},{"created_time":"2012-09-26T11:36:53.000Z","id":"125845680811480_364949100253532","message":"Enjoyed answering the questions submitted by Singaporeans to Singapolitics.sg, which Zuraidah Ibrahim and her team put to me on Monday.

It has been given a beautiful facelift, with many new exhibits to showcase our rich Malay culture. \n \nOne exhibit which caught my eye was a realistic 3D computer rendering of Bugis houses built on stilts over the water. Temasek Poly students did this, working from old plans. The Bugis (who were seafaring traders) used to live in the Kampong Glam area, hence the name Bugis Street.\n \nI hope you will visit the Centre, join in its activities or even volunteer your time to be a guide. \n \nCongratulations to the Malay Heritage Foundation, National Heritage Board and all those in the community who have worked hard to make this Centre a reality!\n\n     Kuning emas warnanya indah\n     Memberi cahaya kepada yang lama\n     Taman Warisan tersergam megah\n     Lambang kebanggaan kita bersama\n\nHari ini saya sangat gembira and bangga kerana dapat merasmikan pembukaan semula Taman Warisan Melayu yang telah dinaik taraf dan diberikan nafas baru.

Orang Bugis pernah menetap di daerah Kampong Glam and begitulah Bugis Street mendapat namanya. \n\nSaya berharap bahawa rakyat Singapura akan menyokong pusat ini dengan melawat dan menyertai aktivitinya, ataupun menjadi sukarelawan di pusat ini. \n\nTahniah kepada Yayasan Warisan Melayu, Lembaga Warisan Kebangsaan dan masyarakat Melayu yang telah bekerja keras untuk menjadikan pusat ini sebuah kenyataan! \u2013 LHL","status_type":"shared_story","story":null,"share_count":25.0},{"created_time":"2012-09-01T01:29:06.000Z","id":"125845680811480_407582222637823","message":"A Happy Teachers\u2019 Day to all who have dedicated their lives to nurturing and providing a quality education to the next generation of Singaporeans! :) - LHL","status_type":"mobile_status_update","story":null,"share_count":30.0},{"created_time":"2012-08-31T17:43:34.000Z","id":"125845680811480_407433472652698","message":"Just heard that our Paralympians Laurentia and Gemma did well in the equestrian team event.

She had a chance, but in the end Ding Ning was too good.  Although Tianwei did not make it to the finals, she put up a great show, and did Singapore proud. \n\nWell done, Tianwei! We wish you every success in the playoff for bronze. - LHL","status_type":"mobile_status_update","story":null,"share_count":72.0},{"created_time":"2012-07-31T08:56:38.000Z","id":"125845680811480_458581400841734","message":"Reshuffled the Cabinet today.

The facilities were basic, the equipment often incomplete. We did not even have steel helmets for everybody. We were issued only the inner liners covered with camouflage nets, except when we went to the firing range.\n\nWhen it came to my sons\u2019 turn to be called up, my wife and I went with them to BMTC at Pulau Tekong. I met many other parents, who had similarly done NS themselves. We (the fathers) all ooh\u2019d and aah\u2019d over the barrack rooms, the cupboards and mattresses, and of course the cookhouse food. We told our sons about the old days, but I am not sure how impressed they were.\n \nLong after we have finished NS, the bonds and friendships remain. Last Sunday, at the Singapore Youth Awards (SYA) Presentation Ceremony, someone came to say hello. He had served under me in 23 SA in 1980, as a gunner. Now he was on the SYA panel choosing the awardees. We were so happy to meet again.\n \nThank you to all our servicemen, regular and NS, for safeguarding our peace, security and progress!

He came to see how Singapore has dealt with the social side of things.

We have gone well past that phase of development. Furthermore, our fundamental aim is to improve the wages of our workers, not join in a race to the bottom. My point was that many jobs which used to be done in the developed countries are gradually migrating to lower-cost providers around the world, such as call centres in the Philippines. This global trend will affect us too.\n\nThe Filipinos will not stop at call centres. They are already moving on higher value-added services such as animation for movies and video games. India has upgraded from running call centres to hosting higher-end business process outsourcing (BPOs), e.g. providing professional services such as legal advice and filing tax returns for Americans, at a fraction of the cost of American lawyers and accountants. \n\nAs more and more services are \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d at the click of a mouse, Singaporean workers will face growing competition. Not just in unskilled and low-paid jobs, but white-collar jobs too; and not just from foreign workers here, but from workers and professionals thousands of miles away in other countries. \n\nThis is why, although we want our workers to earn more, we cannot simply push up Singaporean wages as we would like. Globalisation and technology make this impossible. We will watch the inflow of foreign workers, so that Singaporeans don\u2019t get overwhelmed. But in the long term, the only way for our workers to do better is to compete on knowledge and innovation, upgrade our skills, and stay ahead of the pack. We also have to continue welcoming talent, to boost our competitive edge. This is not easy to do, but the Government will walk this journey with Singaporeans every step of the way. \n\n- LHL","status_type":"mobile_status_update","story":null,"share_count":91.0},{"created_time":"2012-05-15T04:59:00.000Z","id":"125845680811480_357742734288905","message":"A sobering BBC story about the Philippines developing their call centres business, and overtaking India.

But I know workers are concerned about issues like the cost of living, our low-wage workers and our ageing workforce. We are tackling these tough issues directly. \n\nAt the same time, we must get our overall strategies right. Singapore needs to stay open and connected to the world, as a society and a people. It is the only way for a small country to progress and prosper. \n\nSecond, our economy must grow. Not simply by expanding, but by upgrading ourselves, raising productivity and creating better jobs for all. This will give us the resources to build a better Singapore. \n\nThird, all Singaporeans must share the fruits of growth. In particular, we must do our best to help low-wage workers. This is how we build an inclusive society which leaves no Singaporean behind.\n\nI talked about these issues at the May Day Rally. The journey is challenging, but I am confident we will succeed.
